GovStack is a decentralized governance platform built on Stacks blockchain that enables transparent, efficient, and secure decision-making for DAOs. The platform leverages Clarity smart contracts to facilitate proposal creation, voting, and execution.

## Features

- **Proposal Management**: Create and track governance proposals
- **Token-Based Voting**: Voting power proportional to token holdings
- **Secure Execution**: Automated proposal execution based on voting outcomes
- **Quorum Requirements**: Minimum participation thresholds for proposal validity
- **Time-Bound Voting**: Configurable voting periods for proposals

## Smart Contract Overview

### Key Functions

1. `create-proposal`
   - Creates a new governance proposal
   - Requires minimum token threshold
   - Parameters: title, description

2. `cast-vote`
   - Cast votes on active proposals
   - Token-weighted voting system
   - Parameters: proposal-id, vote (true/false), amount

3. `execute-proposal`
   - Executes successful proposals after voting period
   - Requires quorum and majority approval
   - Parameters: proposal-id

### Constants

- Minimum proposal threshold: 1,000,000 tokens
- Voting period: 144 blocks (~24 hours)
- Quorum requirement: 500,000 votes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Stacks wallet
- Governance tokens
- Clarity CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/govstack.git
cd govstack
```

2. Deploy the contract:
```bash
clarinet contract deploy govstack
```

### Usage Example

```clarity
;; Create a new proposal
(contract-call? .govstack create-proposal "Update Protocol" "Proposal to upgrade protocol parameters")

;; Cast a vote
(contract-call? .govstack cast-vote u1 true u5000)

;; Execute proposal
(contract-call? .govstack execute-proposal u1)
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Security Considerations

- Token-weighted voting system
- Time-locked execution
- Quorum requirements
- Access control mechanisms
- Proposal threshold requirements
